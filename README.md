This package provides Vim syntax highlighting for the
[msgenny message sequence chart
language](https://github.com/sverweij/mscgen_js/blob/master/wikum/msgenny.md).
It also includes support for the [mscgenjs CLI
compiler](https://github.com/sverweij/mscgenjs-cli) for the mscgen/msgenny
languages.

Eventually it will probably be expanded to support syntax highlighting for
the mscgen language too.

I personally install it using
[pathogen.vim](https://github.com/tpope/vim-pathogen).
